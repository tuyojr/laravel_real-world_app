> This project's instructions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhO--9fqxrvU5Y6xC52-0AIplQe23LyscqSp6F0_9SM/edit>#). The repository used for deployment is also [here](https://github.com/f1amy/laravel-realworld-example-app).

Below is my main ansible playbook used in deploying this project, which was live at [www.tuyojr.me](https://www.tuyojr.me/) at some point in October/November. All other files, variables and secrets used in the playbook are present in the directory above.
